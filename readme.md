# Urdu Plagiarism Checker

The UrduPlagCheckAI Model makes a significant contribution to the Urdu Adab language. It is an advanced AI solution that effectively identifies and eliminates plagiarism in Urdu text.

### Usage

```bash
> Copy `LSTM.ipynb` to `google colabs`.
> Run All cells
> download model and use it anywhere.
```

## Examples
